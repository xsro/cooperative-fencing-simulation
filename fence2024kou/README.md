This paper proposes a fencing control strategy with a flexible formation to address the fencing control problem of second-order multi-agent systems for a moving target. Specifically, regarding the target moving with an unknown time-varying velocity, a sliding mode estimator accounts to estimate the targets velocity in finite time. In addition, a barrier function is used to avoid collision between agents. Neither the global position measurement nor the fixed fencing formation is required for controller design. It is proven that the controller ensures that the target can be fenced into the convex hull of multi-agent systems, and collision between agents is avoided. Finally, the simulation results verify the efficacy of the proposed controller.
